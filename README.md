# Word Masters Project

## Project Description

- My project is a word guessing game.
- I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this project.
- There is a secret five letter word chosen.
- Players have six guesses to figure out the secret word.
- After six guesses, they lose.
- If the player guesses a letter that is in the right place, it is shown as green.
- If the player guesses the right word, the player wins and the game is over.
