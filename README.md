# JavaScript word_masters project

- I am going to recreate the well known word game Wordle. If you're not familiar with Wordle (which we'll call Word Masters), here's how you play
- There is a secret five letter word chosen.
- Players have six guesses to figure out the secret word.
- After six guesses, they lose.
- If the player guesses a letter that is in the right place, it is shown as green.
- If the player guesses the right word, the player wins and the game is over.
